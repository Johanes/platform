<h1>Governance Artifacts</h1>
<p>
    WSO2 Governance Registry stores governance metadata and information on governance related
    entities.
    Registry resources storing these information and/or metadata are known as Governance Artifacts.
    Examples for Governance Artifacts include Services, WSDLs, Schemas, Processes and People.

<h2>Add Schemas</h2>
<p>
Similar to WSDL importing Governance Registry allow users to add Schema in to registry using add Schema UI.
    User can provide the schema location in to Schema URL and Schema name will be automatically suggested
    as in Add WSDL and Add Policy forms. Successful schema import will redirect the user in to the
currently available imported schema listing page.</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>Similar to WSDLs, WSO2 Governance Registry performs Schema validations on the wsdl provided once importing is done.
    The result is displayed under &#34;properties&#34; section of the imported Schema resource.  Schema validation can optionally be disabled from the registry.xml.  Also, Schema validation requires a connection to the internet for the very first time,
    and will not work on systems with no Internet connectivity.</p>
