<h1>Governance Artifacts</h1>
<p>
    WSO2 Governance Registry stores governance metadata and information on governance related
    entities.
    Registry resources storing these information and/or metadata are known as Governance Artifacts.
    Examples for Governance Artifacts include Services, WSDLs, Schemas, Processes and People.
</p>

<h2>Adding Policies</h2>

<p>User can add Policy by clicking <b>Policies->Add->Service Policy</b> link. This form contains fields,
    policy URL and policy name. Governance Registry will automatically suggest a name for the policy once the URL is entered. Policy will be imported as a resource in to the Governance Registry.
    A successful import will redirect the user to the list view of existing Policies.</p>
