<h1>Deploying Web Applications</h1>

<p>WSO2 AppServer supports Apache Tomcat based web application deployment. Now you can Deploy your
    custom web application under WSO2 AppServer. All you need to do is to bundle your web application
    as a '.war' archive with all your web application-related resources and all third party libraries
    needed, and then deploy the archive.</p>

<p>To deploy the web application, all you have to do is locate
the archive file and upload it. </p>

<h2>Uploading Web Archive Files</h2>

<p>To upload your web archive file, you have to create the '.war' file according to the standard
    web application format.</p>

<p>The folder structure of the web archive file will be as follows.</p>

    <pre>
        HellowWorld.war
            index.html
            *.jsp
            WEB-INF/
                web.xml
                lib/
                classes/
            META-INF/
            images/
    </pre>

<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Manage/Web Applications, click <strong>Add
   </strong>. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to locate the file you want to
  upload. If you want to add multiple Webapps at the same time, click on the
<strong>'+'</strong> sign at the right side, and new additional entry to upload a Webapp archive
will appear each time you click. So you can select all the Webapps you want and deploy them at the same time.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Running Web Applications</strong></em> page
    appears. Subsequently, if the web application is successful, it will appear in
    list. If the web application is faulty, a Faulty Web Application
    Groups link will appear. You can click the link to view the errors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Testing the Web Application</h2>

<p>A successful web application can be easily tested through the user
interface. Several options are available to control your web application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Manage/Web Applications, click <strong>List</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Running Web Applications</strong></em> page appears.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="images/list_WebApp.png" height="322" width="996"/></p>

    Dashboard</strong></em> page appears.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="images/dashboard_WebApp.png" height="391" width="987"/></p>
<p>Figure 3: Web Application Dashboard.</p>
  <li>A page with your web application name appears. It contains the operations
    available for your web application.</li>
  <li>In this page the Session Statistics pane shows the session related statistics collected for the selected webapp.
      The Maximum Concurrent Active Session indicates the maximum number sessions that have been
      concurrently active so far.</li>
  <li>Clicking the 'url' you will be directed the web application's index.html page</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Instead of using this user interface, you can also manually place
the .war containing all the required files
into CARBON_HOME/epository/deployment/webapps.  These archive files will be deployed
as web applications. </p>
