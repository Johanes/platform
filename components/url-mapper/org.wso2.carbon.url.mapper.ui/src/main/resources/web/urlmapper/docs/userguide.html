        <h1>Url Mappings for webapps - User Guide</h1>
        <p>This page contains information on how to shorten your url of your hosted web application in our app server.
            If you deploy a web
            application with us, to access your web application, you need to enter:
            <b>https://ip:port/webappname</b> in your browser. If webapp is deployed in a tenant, then:
            <b>https://ip:port/webapps/t/tenant_domain/webappname</b></p>
        <p>But, now we provide a way to access your webapp with a short url like
            <span style="font-weight: bold;"> https://appid.wso2.com:port/ </span>
            in any case whether you are having tenant or not. All what you need to do is to create
            a appid through your webapp information's page.</p>
        <p>So, simply you are going to own your domain for your hosted web application</p>
        <pre>
        <b>https://ip:port/webapps/t/tenant_domain/webappname ==> https://appid.wso2.com:port</b>
        </pre>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/web_info.png" /></p>
            <p>Figure 1: urlmappings in webapp information page.</p>
        <p>Once the webapp information page appears, when u click on <img alt="" src="images/url.png" />
            will have the options to control over your url mappings such as add, edit, delete.</p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/add.png" /></p>
        <p>Figure 2: adding a urlmapping to webapp</p>
        <p>Once you have created url mapping for your webapp for example :- <b>appid = "exampleapp"</b>,
            then your domain will be <b>"exampleapp.wso2.com"</b>. So, regardless of whether you are a tenant or not,
            you can access your web application by entering the url <b>"https://exampleapp.wso2.com:port"</b>.
            The following image depicts how your web application is accessed through the short url.</p>
        <p>Also, to access your own domain, you need to have a cname.
            In case cname is not available with you at the moment,
            then you can use /etc/hosts to put your domain entries pointing to your local ip. This can be applicable
            only for testing purposes.</p>

        <h1>Url Mappings for Services - User Guide</h1>
        <p>You can follow the above procedure to access your "wsdl" with the short urls.</p>

        <p>Figure 4: url mappings in services-dashboard</p>
        <p>Then, you can access your wsdl using <b>https://appid.wso2.com:port/?wsdl</b></p>
