<h1>Monitored Server Configuration</h1>

<h2>Adding a server</h2>

<p>Server addition is driven by three types of data collection
    methods.</p>

<ol type="1"><li><h3>Polling</h3>
		    WSO2 BAM will poll the server being monitored on a periodic basis. In the
            current implementation the polling interval is one minute and is not
            configurable.
        </li>
<li><h3>Eventing</h3>
		    WSO2 BAM will subscribe to the events published by the server being
            monitored. Event publication is done using WS-Eventing specification. Note that
            for this method to work, the server being added must have a publisher endpoint.
            There are two types of publishers, service data publisher for WSO2 WSAS,
            mediation data publisher for WSO2 ESB that are available as independent components that can be used to
            publish data from those respective server types. See the
            <a href="http://wso2.org/project/bam/java/1.0.0/docs/data_publishers.html">documentation on data
            publishers</a> for more details on data publishers.
        </li>

<li><h3>Generic</h3>
		    WSO2 BAM will neither poll nor subscribe to the server being monitored. The
            server can publish data to WSO2 BAM, using user defined data event publisher.
            This type of a server is useful, when it is desired to store data that does not
            fall into server data or mediation data categories.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>JMX</h3>
        <p>
		    WSO2 BAM is able to collect data of MBeans(JMX enabled applications). Currently WSO2 BAM
		    collects WSO2 ESB's MBean's attributes and values.<br/>
		    <b>Note: There is no visualization(gadgets) part available in this release</b>
        </p>
		</li>
</ol>


<h2>
    Adding a server for polling data
</h2>

<p><img src="images/bam-server-add-polling.png" alt="WSO2 BAM Polling Servers"/></p>

<p>
    For this you have to select
    Polling as the statistics collection method.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 WSAS instances can be
    monitored using data polling mechanism. The versions of WSO2 WSAS supported
    with this model include 3.0.0 and upwards.
</p>

<p>
    You can enter the server URL
    in the following format
</p>

<p><pre><i>https://[host IP | host name]:[port]</i></pre></p>

<p>
    For example:
</p>

<p>
    <pre><i>https://127.0.0.1:9443</i></pre>

    or

    <pre><i>https://localhost:9443</i></pre>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> If you are running
    both WSO2 WSAS and WSO2 BAM on the same server, you MUST run one of the servers
    with a web context name other than root context. See the following document on
    how to <a href="https://www.wso2.org/wiki/display/carbon/same+host+as+standalone+servers+2.0" class="externalLink">
    set a web context with a WSO2 Carbon based servers</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If you are running WSO2 WSAS
    with a Web context, then you have to provide the server URL with the context
    name.
</p>

<p>
    <pre><i>https://[host IP | host name]:[port]/[context name]</i></pre>
</p>

<p>
    For e.g. if <i><b>wsas</b></i> is the web
    context name in use
</p>

<p>
    <pre><i>https://127.0.0.1:9443/wsas</i></pre>

    or

    <pre><i>https://localhost:9443/wsas</i></pre>
</p>

<p>
    When you select the data
    collection method to be polling, the type of statistics that can be collected
    is limited to Service. This is because, with polling model, in the current
    implementation of WSO2 BAM, we only support pulling data from WSO2 WSAS. In other
    words, polling mediation or message level data is not supported.
</p>

<p>
    Since the polling model uses
    the statistics administrative service on WSO2 WSAS server, a user name and
    password with administrative privileges on the WSO2 WSAS server instance is
    also required to add a server to be polled.
</p>

<p>
    You can also provide a
    description of the server being added, which could be useful in your future
    references to the monitored server.
</p>

<h2>

    Adding a server for
    subscribing for events
</h2>

<p><img src="images/bam-server-add-eventing.png" alt="WSO2 BAM Eventing Servers"/></p>

<p>
    For this, you have to select
    <b>Eventing</b> as the statistics collection method. Like in the case of polling, you
    can provide the server URL using the format
</p>

<p>
    <pre><i>https://[host IP | host name]:[port]&lt;/[web context name]&gt;</i></pre>
</p>

<p>
    Also, note that, if you have
    set the <i>HostName</i> setting in the carbon.xml file of the server being added, you
    must use that host name, and not the server IP, when adding the server as
    server URL. If you have not set <i>HostName</i> setting in carbon.xml file of the
    server being added, then you must use the IP address of the server being added,
    in place of the host name. To make sure that you can keep on monitoring the
    server irrespective of IP changes, due to relocation of a server instance that
    is being monitored with WSO2 BAM, it is advised that you use the <i>HostName</i>

    setting in carbon.xml configuration file of the server being monitored and use
    the host name instead of the IP when adding the server to be
    monitored with WSO2 BAM.
</p>

<p>
    The eventing model supports
    Service data and Mediation data.
</p>

<p>
    Service data can be
    collected from service data publishers deployed with WSO2 WSAS instances.
</p>

<p>
    Mediation data can be
    collected from mediation data publishers deployed with WSO2 ESB instances. Note
    that you have to provide nhttps transport port (default 8243), and not the
    management console https port (default 9443), when adding a WSO2 ESB instance.
</p>
<p>
    The corresponding event
    message subscribing endpoints are built into WSO2 BAM and will work out of the
    box. However, you have to ensure that the data publishers are deployed with the
    server being added so that they can publish the data using WS-Eventing. Data
    publishers are shipped as separate components, and you can find more information
    on how to install them in <a href="http://wso2.org/project/bam/java/1.0.0/docs/data_publishers.html">data publishers documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You can also provide a
    description of the server being added, which could be useful in your future
    references to the monitored server.
</p>

<h2>
    Adding a generic server
</h2>

<p><img src="images/bam-server-add-generic.png" alt="WSO2 BAM Generic Servers"/></p>

<p>
    For this, you have to select
    Generic as the data collection method. Once you select Generic, you will have
    to provide only the server URL and server description. The URL will not be
    validated for this case. When you are publishing data to WSO2 BAM against a Generic
    server, all you have to do is to use the server URL given as the data source.
    See documentation on <a href="http://wso2.org/project/bam/java/1.0.0/docs/data_publishers.html">data publishers</a> for more information.
</p>
<h2>
            Adding a JMX server
 </h2>
 <p>
            <img src="images/bam-server-add-jmx.png" alt="WSO2 BAM JMX Servers" title="WSO2 BAM JMX Servers"/>
</p>

<p>
            For this, you have to select
            'JMX' as the data collection method. Once you select JMX, you will have
            to provide server URL,user name,password and server description. The URL will not be
            validated for this case.
            eg:- In WSO2 ESB's conf/carbon.xml enable the JMX server port(which is disabled by default).
            Add the JMX server url as
            <i>jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.100.1.143:9999/server</i>(user can see the jmx server url in ESB server console)
 </p>

<h2>
    List Monitored Servers
</h2>

<p><img src="images/bam-monitored-servers.png" alt="WSO2 BAM Generic Servers"/></p>

<p>
    The monitored server details
    page list the server URL, statistics collection method, statistics type, active/inactive
    status and the description for each server. Based on the current server status,
    you will be able to either <strong>activate</strong> or <strong>deactivate</strong> a monitored server. In the
    active state, data for the server would be collected, using the corresponding
    statistics collection method, and in the inactive state, no current data would be
    collected. Note that, in the current implementation of WSO2 BAM, it is not
    allowed to delete a server, from the management console. This was done purposely,
    to guard against deleting valuable historical data, collected over time, for a
    server. Note that, with BAM, even though a server might not be used any more,
    the data collected against that server would be useful with analytics. Hence,
    rather than deleting, you can retire a server by deactivating it. Even if you
    happen to use a given server for a different set of services, over time, it is
    perfectly fine to use the same server instance in WSO2 BAM, as it captures data
    along with time dimension.
</p>

<p>
    If it is absolutely
    necessary to delete a server instance, then it is advised that you do this at
    the database layer directly.
