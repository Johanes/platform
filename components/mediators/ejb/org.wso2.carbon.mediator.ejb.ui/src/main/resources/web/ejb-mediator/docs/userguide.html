Enterprise beanstalks can be configured in synapse.properties file. Parameters of the JNDI service to be looked up for EJBs should be provided in that configuration. Enterprise beanstalks cache EJB client stubs to improve efficiency by omitting
		excessive JNDI look ups. Cache timeout for both stateless and stateful session beans could be configured separately</p>

	<h2>Session Id</h2>

	<p>Session id of the stateful session bean, null for stateless session beans.</p>
	<h2>Remove</h2>

	<p>Whether or not this bean is removed from the beanstalk after the method invocation.</p>
	<h2>Target</h2>

	<p>Target to store the result of the EJB method call.</p>
	<h2>JNDI Name</h2>
