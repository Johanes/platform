<h1>Relay Transformer Mediator</h1>
<p>
The Relay Transformer Mediator supports all the features provided by the XSLT mediator. In addition
to those features, it supports streaming transformation, where the incoming stream is given directly
to the underlying XSLT processor to do the XSLT transformation. The Relay Transformer
mediator can be used when the ESB started on Message Relay mode. This will give high performance
numbers.

In addition to the above mentioned specific characteristics, Relay Transformer Mediators shows following
characteristics that is there on the XSLT mediator.

The mediator applies the specified XSLT transformation to the selected element of the current
message payload. If the source element is not specified, it defaults to the first child of the soap 
body. Optionally parameters (XSLT) could be passed into the transformations through the 'property' 
field. The 'feature' field defines any features which should be explicitly set to the TransformerFactory. 
The feature 'http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse/transform/feature/dom' turns on DOM based transformations instead 
of serializing elements into Byte streams and/or temporary files. Though this would be better in 
performance than using byte streams, sometimes it may not work for all transformations.

<p><strong>Relay Transformer Mediator</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
Key : The registry key to refer the xslt.
</li>
<li>
Source: Specify in which part of message (specified in xpath) the xslt should be applied. Default is the SOAP body of
the message.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Properties of the Relay Transformer mediator</h2>
<p>
Manage the properties which would be referred from the xslt in transformation (using get-property(prop-name) xpath extension function).

<h2>Features of the Relay Transformer mediator</h2>
<p>
Specify the features to be enabled in the XSLT transformation. Read the introduction paragraph of this guide for an example feature.
