<h1>Registry Resources</h1>

<p>The WSO2 Registry is a repository that stores resources in a structured way.
Here are some of the features provided by the registry interface. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Provides the facility to organize resources into collections. (Similar
    to how you organize files in directories.) </li>
  <li>Keeps multiple versions of resources </li>
  <li>Manages social aspects such as rating of resources </li>
  <li>AtomPub interfaces to publish, view and manage resources from remote or
    non-Java clients </li>
</ul>

<h2>Registry User Interface</h2>
<p>In the navigator, under Registry, click <strong>Resources</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="images/registry.png" width="743px"/></p>

<p>Figure 1 : Registry User Interface </p>

<h2>Components of Registry User Interface</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Breadcrumb">Breadcrumb</a>:- Shows the current directory
    hierarchy  </li>
  <li><a href="#Meta">Meta Data</a>:- Shows meta data for the
    resource/collection </li>
  <li><a href="#Properties">Properties</a>:- Shows properties for the
    resource/collection </li>
  <li><a href="#Content">Content</a>:- Shows the contents of the
    resource/collection  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="Breadcrumb" id="Breadcrumb">Resource Breadcrumb</a></h3>

<p>Use the breadcrumb to navigate backward in the current branch of the
directory path, by clicking on a directory name in the breadcrumb. Note
that you can access the root of the directory path by clicking the Home
icon in the breadcrumb. </p>

<p><img src="images/breadcrumb.png" width="743px"/></p>

<p>Figure 2: The Breadcrumb </p>

<h3><a name="Meta" id="Meta">Meta Data Panel</a></h3>

<p>The meta data panel displays the following properties of the resource
or the collection </p>
<ul>
  <li>Created Time and Author </li>
  <li>Last Updated Time and Author </li>
  <li>Media Type </li>
  <li>URL for the permanent link </li>
  <li>Versions of the resource </li>
  <li>Description about the resource/collection. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><img src="images/metadata.png" width="492px"/></p>

<p>Figure 3 : The meta data panel </p>

<h3><a name="Properties" id="Properties">Properties Panel</a></h3>

<p>This panel displays the properties of the currently selected resource
or collection. New properties can be added, while existing properties can
be edited or deleted.</p>

<p><img src="images/properties.png" width="492px"/></p>

<p>Figure 4 : The properties panel </p>

<h3><a name="Content" id="Content">Content Panel</a></h3>

<p>If the currently selected entity is a collection, the Content Panel
shows the child entries under that collection. It provides details of each
entry. An entry can be either another collection or a resource. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Name - Click to access the content of this entry </li>
  <li>Created Date </li>
  <li>Author </li>
  <li>Ratings</li>
  <li>The link to the Atom feed </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/entries.png" width="492px"/></p>

<p>Figure 5 : View of Directory Entries </p>

<p>If the currently selected entity is a resource, the Content panel
provides a user interface through which you can display, edit upload, and
download the content.</p>

<h2>Symbolic Links and Remote Links</h2>

<p>Symbolic links and Remote links can be created in a similar way to adding a normal resource.
Add resource drop down list contains options to add symbolic and remote links.</p>

<p><img src="images/add_symlink.png" width="492px"/></p>
<p>Figure 7 : Add Symbolic Link </p>

<p>When adding a symbolic link, you have to provide a name for the link and the path of an existing
resource or collection which is being linked. It creates a link to the particular resource.
The created symbolic link is shown by an icon with an arrow in the entries panel.</p>

<p><img src="images/symlink.png" width="492px"/></p>
<p>Figure 8 : Symbolic Link</p>

<p>Adding a Remote link is much similar to adding a symbolic link. You can mount a collection in a
remotely deployed registry instance to your registry instance by adding a remote link. You can
provide a name for the remote link in the name field, and choose the instance to which you are going
to mount (Please refer the registry user guide to see how to configure the remote instances in
registry.xml). You can give the path of the remote collection which you need to mount for the path
field, or else the root collection will be mounted. </p>

<p><img src="images/add_remotelink.png" width="492px"/></p>
<p>Figure 9 : Add Remote Link</p>

<p>After mounting the remote collection you can access and work on that collection from your local
instance.</p>


<h2>Media Types</h2>

<p>
Each collection or resource that you create and store on the repository has an associated media
type. However, you also have the option to leave this unspecified enforcing the default media type.
There are two main ways in which you can configure media types for resources.
</p>

<p>
The first method is by means of a one-time configuration which can be done by modifying the
<strong>mime.types</strong> file found in the server configuration directory. This can be done just
once before the initial start-up of the server.
</p>

<p>
The second method is to configure the media types via the server administration console. For
collections the first method does not apply, and the only available mechanism is to configure the
media types via the server administration console.
</p>

<p>
Initially the system will contain the media types defined in the <strong>mime.types</strong> file
will be available for resources and a set of default media types will be available for collections.
</p>

<p>
Managing media types for resources can be done via the server administration console, by editing the
properties of the <strong>/_system/config/repository/components/org.wso2.carbon.governance/media-types/index</strong> collection. This collection contains two
resources, <strong>collection</strong> and <strong>custom.ui</strong>. To manage media types of
collections and custom user interfaces, you need to edit the properties of these two resources.
</p>

<p>Figure 10 : Editing Media Types</p>


<h2>Optional Portlets</h2>

<h3>Adding Subscriptions</h3>

<p>The <strong>Subscriptions</strong> portlet allows you to add subscriptions to resources and
collections. Clicking <strong>Add Subscription</strong> brings up a form which allows users to
create new subscriptions. If you already have any subscriptions, they will be listed in a table
displayed within this portlet.</p>

<p><img src="images/add_subscription.png" width="340px" /></p>

<p>Figure 11: Add Subscriptions</p>


<p>Once a subscription has been added, you are also allowed to delete
subscriptions (or unsubscribe), by clicking on the relevant <strong>Delete</strong> link.</p>

<p><img src="images/manage_notifications.png" width="340px" /></p>

<p>Figure 12: Manage Notifications</p>

<p>Adding a subscription involves selecting the event type and the notification method. The event
types supported by default are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check LC Item   - Represents an event that fires when a item is checked in a lifecycle
  check-list.</li>
  <li>Uncheck LC Item - Represents an event that fires when a item is unchecked in a lifecycle
  check-list.</li>
  <li>Create Child    - Represents an event of creating a resource (or collection) within an
  existing collection.</li>
  <li>Delete Child    - Represents an event of deleting a resource (or collection) within an
  existing collection.</li>
  <li>Delete          - Represents an event of deleting a resource (or collection).</li>
  <li>Create LC       - Represents an event of creating a lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Delete LC       - Represents an event of deleting a lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Change LC State - Represents an event of changing a lifecycle state.</li>
  <li>Update          - Represents an event of updating a resource or collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that some of these events may not be available for certain types resources and
collections. We support a variety of notification methods as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>E-mail          - Any valid e-mail address.</li>
  <li>HTML/Plain-Text - An endpoint accepting HTML or text content.</li>
  <li>SOAP            - An endpoint accepting notifications as a SOAP message.</li>
  <li>User Profile    - A valid user's profile. Notifications will be sent to the e-mail address
  specified on the user's default profile.</li>
  <li>Group Profile   - A valid role. Notifications will be sent to all the users in the
  specified role.</li>
  <li>Work list       - A valid role. Notifications will be sent to work-list for role.</li>
  <li>JMX             - Notifications will be sent via JMX.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the notification method you select, you may be required to provide additional
information, such as the e-mail address to use of the name of the user of whom the profile will be
used. Having done this step, you will have to click on the <strong>Subscribe</strong> button to add
a subscription (see Figure above).</p>
