Sample: Jibx
============

Introduction
============

This sample demonstrate a usage  of Jibx data binding that comes with Axis2. JiBX differs from the
other data binding techniques supported by Axis2 in that it allows you to use your own Java data
objects (as opposed to Java data objects generated from a schema definition). JiBX also provides a
nicer form of unwrapped Web services interface than is supported by the other data binding techniques.
 On the downside, JiBX requires more setup than the other data binding techniques - in particular, you
 need to come up with a set of data classes and a binding definition in order to work with JiBX in Axis2.

Building the Service
====================

To build the sample service, go to samples directory and type: "ant" 

This will build LibraryService.aar in the target directory and copy it to the
<CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/axis2services directory.

The WSDL for this service should be viewable at:

http://<host>:<port>/services/LibraryService?wsdl


Running the Client
==================

To run the sample client for the service, go to samples directory and user either run-client.sh in Linux or
run-client.bat in Windows. 

Or else you can use AppServer features to generate the client stubs pointing to the wsdl and invoke the service with that
Or invoke the service with Try-It 

Help
====
Please contact appserver java user list (appserver-java-user@wso2.org), if you have any trouble running the sample.
