Java First demo using jax-ws APIs and jsr-181
=============================================
This demo illustrates how to develop a service using the "code first"
approach using the JAX-WS APIs.

Building and running the demo using Maven
---------------------------------------
From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is
located), the pom.xml file is used to build and run the demo. 

Using either UNIX or Windows:

  * mvn clean install (builds the demo and creates a WAR file)
  * Start the server (run bin/wso2server.sh/.bat)
  * mvn -Pdeploy (deploys the generated WAR file on WSO2 AS with related logs on the console)
  * mvn -Pclient (runs the client)

Maven exec-maven-plugin is used to run the client. If you want to change the EPR of the service,
you can change it on the pom.xml. Default is set to..

http://localhost:9763/java_first_jaxws/services/hello_world

To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class
files, run "mvn clean".

NOTE : Prior to running the client (mvn -Pclient) good to confirm the generated WSDL
can be seen from a web browser at: 
http://{ip}:{port}/java_first_jaxws/services/hello_world?wsdl
