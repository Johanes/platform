        <h1>Step-by-Step Guide on Creating Data Services Using Excel Data Sheet</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>WSO2 Data Services Server supports to expose data in Excel 97-2007 as a service.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Sample Excel Data sheet</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Before we start on create the data service we will create an excel sheet which contains
            three columns, namely ID, Model and Classification (i.e. Do not paste the above content
            into a single cell). Fill the data sheet with some values under those three columns.

            <b>Step 1: Start by giving a name</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Lets start create the data service by click on "Create" link under
            Manage/Services/Add/Data Service.
            We will name the service as ExcelSampleService. Click on "Next" button once you enter
            the name, and the description if required.
