        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            WSO2 Web Services Framework for Java (WSF/Java) provides the complete framework
            for developing Web Services or Web Service clients. Basically this contains all
            the libraries you need to write a service or client.</p>

        <p>
            WSF/Java includes all WS-Security (Rampart), WS-ReliablieMessage (Sandesha) etc.
            libraries and Axis2 modules (.mar archives) which you need in developing complex
            services and clients.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        
        <p>
            You can find all needed libraries in the WSF_JAVA_HOME/lib directory. If you want to
            develop a Web Service or a Cliet for a Web Service, all you have to do is to add 
            those libraries into your java classpath and use the API. You can go through the 
            set of samples which are shipped with WSO2 WSF to clearly understand how to use the
            client API for different use cases.
        </p>
