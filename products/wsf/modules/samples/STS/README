WSO2 WSF/Java
=============

Sample : A client to demonstrate the use of Security Token Service
==================================================================

This is a client which can invoke the STS service which comes with the WSO2 Application Server.
This sample demonstrates how to write a client to consume the Security Token Service (STS).

If you want to run the sample, you have to host the STS service in a running WSO2
AppServer instance. There are different options to achieve that.

1. Download WSO2 AppServer and deploy the service.
2. Create a tenant in WSO2 Cloud infrastructure (Stratos) and deploy the service in AppServer
   cloud service.
3. Deploy the service in WSO2 AppServer AMI.

Configure the service by going through STS sample guide in the WSO2 AppServer Documentation.

Running the client
==================

1. Run "ant" on WSF_HOME/samples/STS directory.
2. Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client.

   run-client.sh <wso2carbon-sts-http-address> <hello-service-http-address>

If you want more details on how to deploy the service etc, please download the WSO2 Application
Server Documentation Distribution and refer to the STS sample document.
