WSO2 WSF/Java
=============

Sample : JSON Client
====================

This is a client which can invoke the JSON service sample which comes with the WSO2
Application Server. This sample demonstrates how to write a client for a JSON Web Service.

If you want to run the sample, you have to host the JSON service in a running WSO2
AppServer instance. There are different options to achieve that.

1. Download WSO2 AppServer and deploy the service.
2. Create a tenant in WSO2 Cloud infrastructure (Stratos) and deploy the service in AppServer
   cloud service.
3. Deploy the service in WSO2 AppServer AMI.

Running the client
==================

After deploying the service using one of the above options, use the following steps to run the
client.

1. Run "ant" on WSF_HOME/samples/JSON directory.
2. Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using following
   optional parameters
   -help {For help on available options}
   -e {Endpoint URL}
   -ct {Content type to be used}
        aj  (application/json)
        ajb (application/json/badgerfish)

   ex: ./run-client.sh -ct ajb

If you want more details on how to deploy the service etc, please download the WSO2 Application
Server Documentation Distribution and refer to the JSON sample document.
