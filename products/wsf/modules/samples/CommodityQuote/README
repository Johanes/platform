WSO2 WSF/Java
=============

Sample : CommodityQuote Client
==============================

This is a client which can invoke the CommodityQuote service sample which comes with the WSO2
Application Server. This sample demonstrates how to write clients for Web Services using different
quality of service options like WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging etc.

If you want to run the sample, you have to host the CommodityQuote service in a running WSO2
AppServer instance. There are different options to achieve that.

1. Download WSO2 AppServer and deploy the service.
2. Create a tenant in WSO2 Cloud infrastructure (Stratos) and deploy the service in AppServer
   cloud service.
3. Deploy the service in WSO2 AppServer AMI.

After deploying the service using one of the above options, use the following steps to run the
client.

1. Run "ant" on WSF_HOME/samples/CommodityQuote directory.
2. Run "sh run-client.sh -help" for help on various available options.

If you want more details on this and like to understand more on security and RM scenarios, please
download the WSO2 Application Server Documentation Distribution and refer to the CommodityQuote
sample document.
