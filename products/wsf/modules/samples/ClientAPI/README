Sample : Client API
====================

This sample demonstrates the Axis2 Client API. There are different ways of writing clients for
Web Services and all those are covered by this sample.

If you want to run the sample, you have to host the ClientAPIDemoService (which comes with
WSO2 AppServer) in a running WSO2 AppServer instance. There are different options to achieve that.

1. Download WSO2 AppServer and deploy the service.
2. Create a tenant in WSO2 Cloud infrastructure (Stratos) and deploy the service in AppServer
   cloud service.
3. Deploy the service in WSO2 AppServer AMI.


Running the client
==================

Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using following
optional parameters.

   -help {For help on available options}
   -e {Endpoint URL}

Then select the type of Client that you want to execute.

1. Blocking Client
2. Single Channel Non Blocking Client
3. Dual Channel Non Blocking Client
4. Dynamic Blocking Client
5. RPC Client
6. Fire and Forget Client
