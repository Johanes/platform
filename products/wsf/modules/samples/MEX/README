WSO2 WSF/Java
=============

Sample : MEX Client
===================

This is a client which can invoke the MEX service sample which comes with the WSO2
Application Server. This sample demonstrates how to write a client to invoke a Web Service using
WS-MetadataExchange standards.

If you want to run the sample, you have to host the MEX service in a running WSO2
AppServer instance. There are different options to achieve that.

1. Download WSO2 AppServer and deploy the service.
2. Create a tenant in WSO2 Cloud infrastructure (Stratos) and deploy the service in AppServer
   cloud service.
3. Deploy the service in WSO2 AppServer AMI.


Running the client
==================

1. Run "ant" on WSF_HOME/samples/MEX directory.
2. Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client.

   ex: ./run-client.sh

   Following optional parameters can be used when running the client

	-e	    : Endpoint URL of the service
	-help	: For Help

If you want more details on how to deploy the service etc, please download the WSO2 Application
Server Documentation Distribution and refer to the MEX sample document.
