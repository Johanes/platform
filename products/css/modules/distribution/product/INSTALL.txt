Installing WSO2 NoSQL Cluster
=============================

WSO2 NoSQL Storage Cluster should be configured to access by other WSO2 products/services. This is not an standalone service.

Standalone Mode
=======================
1. The directory containing this INSTALL.txt file will be the root and it will be
   treated as Carbon home directory and let it be CARBON_HOME.

2. All the shell scripts and .bat files are available in CARBON_HOME/bin folder.

3. To start LB one can use either wso2server.sh or daemon.sh in all Unix
   systems & wso2server.bat file on Windows operating systems.

4. Either of the following commands can be used to start ESB
      i)  ./wso2server.sh {console|start|stop|restart|status|dump|version}
     ii)  ./daemon.sh {console|start|stop|restart|status|dump}
    iii)  wso2server.bat {start|stop|version}

System Requirements
=======================
1. Minimum memory - 256MB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
3. Java SE Development Kit 1.5.13 or higher
4. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 6 and 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
   NOTE:
     On Windows Server 2003, it is not allowed to go below the medium security
     level in Internet Explorer 6.x and the default medium security setting with
     IE does not allow sufficient level of JS or ActiveX enablement for the
     management console to run.
5. To compile and run the sample clients, an Ant version is required. Ant 1.7.0
   version is recommended
6. To build WSO2 ESB from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have
   JDK 1.5.x version and Maven 2.1.0 or later
