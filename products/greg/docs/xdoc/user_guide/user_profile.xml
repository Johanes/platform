<h1> WSO2 Governance Registry - User Guide </h1>
<h2 id="upm">User Profile Management</h2>

<p>The User Profile Management component of the WSO2 Carbon facilitates the management
and control of user's details. The key functionality of this component include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add new profiles</li>
  <li>Add and modify details of a user in profile</li>
</ul>
    <p>
The user profile component can be invoked in two ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Administrator or a person with &quot;Manage Security&quot; functionality can add/edit/view profiles of users</li>
	<li>If the product is configured, the user himself can edit his profile</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>External profiles of a JDBC user store can be viewed only</i></p>
