<h1>The WSO2 Complex Event Processing Server (CEP) @product.version@ Released!</h1>
<h3>@timestamp@</h3>

<p>
    The WSO2 CEP team is pleased to announce the release of version @product.version@ of
    the Open Source Complex Event Processing Server (CEP).
</p>
<p>WSO2 Complex Event Processing Server (WSO2 CEP) is to be your Complex
Event Processing System. Our ultimate goal is to provide you with the suitable capability 
of defining , filtering and triggering events according to your organization's 
decisions</p>

<p>CEP 1.0.0 supports analyzing input events and triggering new events according to the rules
defined by your organization.</p>

<p>WSO2 CEP @product.version@ is developed on top of the revolutionary <a
href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">Carbon platform</a> 
, and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the better modularity for
your Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This also contains a lots of new
features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, CEP can be
customized to your SOA needs. </p>
