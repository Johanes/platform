                        WSO2  Business Rules Server 1.2.0
================================================================================

Welcome to the WSO2 BRS 1.2.0 release

WSO2 BRS is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source  Business Rules Server
(BRS) is available under the Apache Software License v2.0. and WSO2 BRS supports
exposing business decisions as secure and reliable web services and integrating 
business decisions to the organizationsâ€™ application integration infrastructure.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features
have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

Key Features of WSO2 BRS
==================================
* Ability to write scripts for Drools rule engine
* Support any JSR94 based rule engine
* Wizard for service creation
* WS-Security support for external services
* WS-Security support for business rule services.
* System monitoring.
* Try-it for business rule services.
* SOAP Message Tracing.
* Web Services tooling support such as WSDL2Java, Java2WSDL and WSDL Converter.
* Customizable server - You can customize the BRS to fit into your
  exact requirements, by removing certain features or by adding new
  optional features.

System Requirements
==================================

1. Minimum memory - 1 GB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
3. Java SE Development Kit 1.6.0_21 or higher
4. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 6 and 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
   NOTE:
     On Windows Server 2003, it is not allowed to go below the medium security
     level in Internet Explorer 6.x and the default medium security setting with
     IE does not allow sufficient level of JS or ActiveX enablement for the
     management console to run.
5. To compile and run the sample clients, an Ant version is required. Ant 1.7.0
   version is recommended
6. To build WSO2 BRS from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have
   JDK 1.6 or higher version and Maven 2.1.0 or later
