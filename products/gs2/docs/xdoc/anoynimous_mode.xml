        <h1>WSO2 Gadget Server in Anonymous mode</h1>
        <p>
            When a new user first launches the portal, the WSO2 Gadget Server provides the same user experience he/she will
            have in
            signed in mode. There will be a set of default gadgets displayed for the user and more gadgets are shown in
            add gadgets drop-down.
            The user can drag-drop gadgets and create his/her own gadget layout as preferred. <br />
</p>
<p>User data storage in anonymous mode is done using a browser cookie based storage mechanism.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The anonymous mode will not give the user access to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Enterprise Gadget Repository</span> and adding gadgets by specifying a URL is also disabled.
