        <h1>Role Based Gadgets</h1>
<p>This is a new feature provided for  gadget server users from WSO2 Gadget Server release 1.4.0 onwards.
 <br /><br />
Signed-in users have different roles.According to those roles,Gadget Server administrator has the priviledge of controlling users' accessability for viewing gadgets in the portal.This feature provides only for the gadgets stored in registry.
 </p>
            <h2>Set gadget permissions for  roles</h2>
            <p>In the folowing example,there are two users called 'user1' and 'user2' having roles as developer1 and developer2.Administrator has allowed to read the gadget for the users having the role 'Developer1' while denying it for the users having the role 'Developer2'.

 <h2>Add role-based gadgets</h2>
            <p>When 'user1' signed in to the gadget server,he could successfully add the above permission set gadget from the gadget repository to the portal.
<br /><br />
                <img alt="add gadget" src="images/add_gadget_user1.png" space="preserve" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" /></p>
 <p>          
But when 'user2' signed in to the gadget server and tried to add the above gadget,he will get an error message saying that he does not have enough permissions to add the  gadget.
