        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction to Message Broker</h2>
        <p>This gives a brief introduction of how message broker can be used
            in publishing and receiving messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            WSO2 Message Broker is basically consist of two major features. They are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pub/ Sub Feature</li>
            <li>Message box feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Pub/Sub Feature
        </h3>

        <p>This feature of the WSO2 Message Broker provides the facility for users to route messages
            to the required users. If we are explaining deeply,
            there is a concept called 'Topic' and message routing is done on the base of that
            topic. When a particular user want to publish
            a message to a particular sector , he creates a topic with a name related to the
            messages that he is going to pulish. As an example, if a particular
            user want to publish messages related with sports news, he can create a topic with the
            name 'SportsNews' and publish the messages to that topic.
        </p>

        <p>
            When another particular user is interested on any topic in the topic tree, he can
            subscribe to that topic and receive messages which are published
            to that topic by the publisher. As in the above example, when a particular user is
            interested on sports, he can subscribed to the topic 'SportsNews'
            and get messages published to that topic.
        </p>

        </p>


        <h3>Message box Feature</h3>


        <p>This feature of the WSO2 Message Broker provides the facility for users to store messages
            in an intermediate location which were sent by some one else to the user and
            access them on demand. In order to have this feature, WSO2 Message Broker uses a
            Message Queue and all the operations are carried out on that message queue.
            This message box feature is like the email box we have, more clearly , any one can send
            messages to Queue and only the owner of the queue can consume the messages
            stored in that queue.
        </p>

                     alt="Subscribe to topics"/>
            </p>

            <li>Topic</li>
            <p>User does not need to specify the topic here , since its automatically sets up.</p>

            <li>Subscription Mode</li>

            <p>This is the mode of the subscription and there are three modes.</p>

            <p>The default mode for the subscription is "Topic Only". With this mode , user creates
                the
                subscription only to the topic. In this mode subscribers only receive events which
                are published only to the that topic.

            <p>This is the URL which the subscriber should provide to receive events published. When
                events are
                published to the topic, they are sent to the specified URL here.
            </p>

            <li>Expiration Time</li>
            <p>Here user can specify the expiration time of the subscription. This is not a required
                parameter and
                if user leave it alone, subscription will never be expired.
            </p>

            <p>Note : You can create a simple axis2service and use it's URL as the EventSinkURL .
                Inorder to create an axis2service ,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browse the location : /wso2mb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/samples/services/EventSinkService
                </li>
                <li>Type the command : ant</li>

                <P>(This ant task will create a simple axis2service 'EventSinkService' and deploy it
                    in the location :
                    /wso2mb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/repository/deployment/server/axis2services/ )
                </P>
            </ul>

            <p>Now you can create a subscription by providing the Event Sink URL :
                https://localhost:9443/services/EventSinkService/getOMElement
            </p>

            <p>Click on the button 'Subscribe' and it will create the subscription and list it in
                the subscription table of that topic in topic details page.
            </p>

                     alt="Topic subscription details"/>
            </p>


            <li>Step 05</li>

            <p>At the end of the subscribing process , you can test whether the topic and the
                subscriptions created are working fine.
                In order to do that what you have to do is type a XML message in the provided text
                box and under the 'Publish' section
                of Topic Details page and click on 'Publish button'
            </p>

            <p>Then check the command line and you will be able to see the XML Message that you
                types in the provided space.
            </p>

        </ul>


        <h3>How to use Message box/SQS feature</h3>

        <p>Message box is a simple queue where user can store, retrieve and delete messages. Message
            box provides the Simple Queue Service(SQS) operations. In SQS,
            When a message is received by a user, that message is unaccessible for a specified time
            duration, and this message is not visible for other users till that specified time
            duration is over. If the message received user did not delete the message in that time
            duration, the message is visible for other users. This time duration is named as
            visibility timeout.
        </p>

        <p>For more information regarding SQS, please refer links provided at references.</p>

        <li>Create a message box</li>
        <p>Click on the add menu under the item messageboxes/SQS. Then provide a name for the
            message box and a default visibility timeout value in seconds.
            If the message box is created successfully, It will be displayed at the message box list.
        </p>

            <img src="images/createMB.png"
                 alt="Create Message Box"/>
        </p>

        <li>List message boxes</li>
        <p>To view created message boxes, click on list menu under item messageboxes(SQS).</p>
        <p>To view message box content, click on message box name</p>

                 alt="List Message Boxes"/>
        </p>

        <li>Using the message box</li>
        <p>User can view the content of the message box by going through link in list view. In
            message box page, users can do following things.
        </p>
        <p>View messages which are retrievable under content of message box.
        </p>
        <p>Add messages to message box. These messages are added under retrievable messages of
            message box.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/addMessage.png"
                 alt="Add Message To Message Box"/>
        </p>

        <p>Retrieve messages from message box. User can set visibility timeout value for retrieving
            messages and the number of messages to retrieve. Retrieved messages are added under
            retrieved messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/retrieveMessage.png"
                 alt="Retrieve Messages From Message Box"/>
        </p>
        <p>View retrieved messages from message box. These messages are displayed under the table
            retrieved messages from message box. If user did not delete these messages before
            visibility timeout, those messages will be available to retrieve for other users. If
            user tried to retrieved messages with low visibility timeout value, they will be
            retrieved and will be visible to retrieve again.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/addPermission.png"
                 alt="Add Permissions on Message Box"/>
        </p>
        <p>Message box can be shared with other users for five operations such as Send, Receive,
            Delete, ChangeVisibility and GetQueueAttributes. Those permissions allowed users can
            access queue for above operations. Permission label is defined for each allowed
            permission set. This label is used to delete allowed permissions.
