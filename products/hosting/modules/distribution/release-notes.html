<h1>WSO2 Web Services Application Server(WSO2 WSAS) 3.1
    Release Notes</h1>

<h3>${buildNumber}</h3>

<p>WSO2 WSAS is the Enterprise ready Web services engine powered by Apache
   Axis2.
   It is a lightweight application server for Web services that
   incorporates leading open source components into a simple, easy-to-use and
   highly performant package. WSAS is based
   on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [2] framework, Middleware a la carte'.
   Now you can adopt the middleware to suite your enterprise architecture.
   All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.
</p>

<p>It supports Java components as services using both SOAP and REST models.
   Web services support include WS-Security, WS-Trust, WS-SecureConversation,
   WS-Reliable Messaging, WS-Addressing, WS-Policy, WS-SecurityPolicy and more,
   giving a fully secure and reliable infrastructure that interoperates with
   both
   J2EE and .NET frameworks using open standard protocols.</p>

<p>WSO2 WSAS is built on Apache Axis2, the popular Web services framework
   mainly developed by WSO2 engineers. WSO2 WSAS provides many value additions
   on top of
   Axis2,
   making it a more enterprise ready product. It also integrates other core
   Apache Web
   services projects such as Apache Axiom, Apache Rampart, Apache Sandesha2, Apache Savan
   , and Apache Neethi to form a production quality, comprehensive Web
   services server platform.</p>

<p>An open source product, WSO2 WSAS is available under the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol>
    <li>POJO to Web service feature is still at an experimental stage. One can
        upload jar/zip file and can create an AAR out of it. If you uploaded a
        jar/zip file which has the semantics of an AAR, when it's transformed
        into
        an AAR, its services.xml will be replaced by the generated services.xml.
        In
        addition to this, the user cannot associate any library dependencies
        or web content with the generated AAR file.
        <ul>
            <li>Due to limitations in Axis2, method overloading is not
                supported,
                and hence the WSDL for services where methods are overloaded
                cannot
                be generated. Hence all WSDL based functionality related to such
                services
                will not work.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>WS-Policy support is limited to policy expressions with a single policy
        alternative.
    </li>
    <li>You cannot have two different versions of the Apache Sandesha2 module
        in the system.
    </li>
    <li>Persistent RM is still in the experimental stage</li>
    <li>A &lt;parameter name="OmitSOAP12Action"&gt;true&lt;/parameter&gt; entry
        has been added to the HTTP &amp; HTTPS transportSenders in order to
        overcome some issues with some browsers. In case of interoperability
        failures, please change the value of this parameter to false and
        retry.
    </li>
    <li>The 'Try It' feature does not work for MTOM enabled services.</li>
    <li>Cannot connect to a JMX service using a JMX client tool such as jconsole
        from a remote
        machine
        when the server is running on Linux. See
        http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6209663.
        To rectify this, you should edit the /etc/hosts file on the server
        machine and set
        the correct IP
        address.
    </li>
    <li>Data Services, Axis1 services, Javascript services &amp; POJO services
        cannot be
        deployed using the URL-based repository configuration
    </li>
</ol>
