        <h2>Setting Up the Environment and Tools</h2>

        <h3>Maven:</h3>

        <p>The WSO2 Mashup Server build is based on <a
                href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. Hence, a prerequisite to
            build WSO2 Mashup Server from the source distribution is to have Maven and JDK
            installed. Extensive instructions are available on the Maven site.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may need to set the MAVEN_OPTS if you come across OutOfMemory errors during
            the build. e.g. you may need to set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
        </p>

        <p>This guide however contains the easiest path for quick environment
            setting. Advanced users can <a

        <ul>
            <li>MS Windows

                <ol>
                    <li>Download and run the Windows installer package</li>
                    <li>Set the 'Environment Variables' (create the system variable M2_HOME and
                        edit the path. e.g., "set M2_HOME=C:\Program Files\Apache Software
                        Foundation\maven-2.1.x"; set path=%path%;%M2_HOME%\bin)
                    </li>

                        is set to the location of
                        your JDK, e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24
                    </li>
                    <li>Run 'mvn --version' to verify that it is correctly installed.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The tar ball or the zip archive is the best option. Once the archive is
                        downloaded, expand it to a directory of choice and set the environment
                        variable M2_HOME and add M2_HOME/bin to the path as well. You can also refer
                        to more instructions on

        <p>Once Maven is properly installed, you can start building the WSO2 Mashup Server for
            Java.

        <h2>Building WSO2 Mashup Server from the Source Distribution</h2>

        <p>The
            <a
                    href="http://wso2.org/downloads/mashup">source
                distribution
            </a>
            is available as a zipped archive. All the necessary build
            scripts are included with the source distribution. Expand the source archive
            to a directory of your choice. You can run the following commands inside that
            directory to build the WSO2 Mashup Server.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The list of commands that can be run are as follows:</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            The first time you run Maven, it will automatically
            download the dependent .jars. Therefore, the first run will take more
            time. The third party libraries required by WSO2 Mashup Server will be downloaded from the
            Maven2 repositories specified in the main pom.xml file.
