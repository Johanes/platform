            <h2>The Javascript Stub Generator</h2>

            <p>The Javascript Stub
                Generator can be accessed by pointing your browser to
                <a href="https://localhost:9443/carbon/js_stub_generator/index.jsp">
                    https://localhost:9443/carbon/js_stub_generator/index.jsp
                </a>
                in a local server installation. Using this tool you can either provide
                a URL of a WSDL (1.1 or 2.0) document or upload a WSDL (1.1 or 2.0) document from your local file
                system to generate a Javascript stub to the Web Service in concern.
                This stub can then be imported and used in the mashups to access this
                Web Service with your Javascript as described in the
                <a href="generatedresources.html#JavaScript">JavaScript
                    Stubs
