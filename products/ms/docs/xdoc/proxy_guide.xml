        <h1>Running behind an Apache HTTPD Proxy</h1>

        <p>In a production environment or the network is under certain constrains, it is
            sometime necessary to run WSO2 Mashup Server behind a proxy or a firewall. Though Mashup Server
            should be behind a proxy or firewall, the ultimate end user should not see this
            information.
        </p>
        <p>Mashup Server has been designed to run on top of Embedded Tomcat or in Servlet containers
            such as Tomcat, JBoss, Web Logic etc. Thus, Mashup Server has two mode of operations.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>As an embedded server on top of Embedded Tomcat.</li>
            <li>In a Servlet container.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When Mashup Server has been configured to run on prior modes, it will be give two different
            axis2.xml by default. This section describes the configuration of theses axis2.xmls,
            when Mashup Server is running behind a proxy or a firewall.
        </p>

        <p>Lets assume you have enabled
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Mode 1:</h3>

        <p>axis2.xml is available in "conf" directory, where Mashup Server is installed. Find the elements
            that has the tag name transportReceiver. You will be able to find a commented parameter
            named "proxyPort". Uncomment this one and your Mashup Server instance is ready for accept request
            coming through the proxy. You should uncomment the @proxyPort parameter in both http and
            https listeners.
        </p>


        <h3>Mode 2:</h3>

        <p>axis2.xml is available in the location where you have given as the Mashup Server home. By default
            this will be $USER_HOME/.wso2mashup. Find the elements that has the tag name transportReceiver.
            You will be able to find a commented parameter named "proxyPort". Uncomment this one and your
            Mashup Server instance is ready for accept request coming through the proxy. You should uncomment the
            @proxyPort parameter in both http and https listeners.
