            <h1>WSO2 Mashup Server Distribution</h1>
            <div class="section"><h2>Overview</h2>This project uses
                <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
                to manage its source code. Instructions on Subversion use can be found at<a
                        href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Web Access</h2>
                <p>There is no online source repository listed for this project. Please check back again later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Anonymous access</h2>
                <p>The source can be checked out anonymously from SVN with this command:</p>
                <div class="source">
                    <pre>$ svn checkout http://www.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/mashup/java</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Developer access</h2>
                <p>Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTP, but Committers must checkout the
                    Subversion repository via HTTPS.
                </p>
                <div class="source">
                    <pre>$ svn checkout https://www.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/mashup/java</pre>
                </div>
                <p>To commit changes to the repository, execute the following command to commit your changes (svn
                    will prompt you for your password)
                </p>
                <div class="source">
                    <pre>$ svn commit --username your-username -m &quot;A message&quot;</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Access from behind a firewall</h2>
                <p>For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is blocking HTTP access to the
                    Subversion repository, you can try to access it via the developer connection:
                </p>
                <div class="source">
                    <pre>$ svn checkout svn checkout http://www.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/mashup/java</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Access through a proxy</h2>
                <p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do so. First, edit your
                    &quot;servers&quot; configuration file to indicate which proxy to use. The file's location
                    depends on your operating system. On Linux or Unix it is located in the directory &quot;~/.subversion&quot;.
                    On Windows it is in &quot;%APPDATA%\Subversion&quot;. (Try &quot;echo %APPDATA%&quot;, note this
                    is a hidden directory.)
                </p>
                <p>There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have that file, get the latest
                    Subversion client and run any command; this will cause the configuration directory and template
                    files to be created.
                </p>
                <p>Example: Edit the 'servers' file and add something like:</p>
                <div class="source">
                    <pre>
                        [global]
                        http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
                        http-proxy-port = 3128
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
