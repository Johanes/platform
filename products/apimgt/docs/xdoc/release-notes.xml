<h1>The WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) 4.0.0 Released!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 ESB team is pleased to announce the release of version 4.0.0 of
    the Open Source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 ESB is a fast, lightweight and user friendly open source Enterprise Service
    Bus (ESB) distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
    Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 ESB allows system administrators and developers to
    easily configure message routing, intermediation, transformation, logging, task
    scheduling, fail over routing and load balancing. It also supports transport
    switching, eventing, rule based mediation and priority based mediation for advanced
    integration requirements. The ESB runtime is designed to be completely asynchronous,
    non-blocking and streaming based on the <a href="http://synapse.apache.org">Apache
    Synapse</a> mediation engine.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 ESB 4.0.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
    components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the ESB. Further, any
    existing features of the ESB which are not required to your environment can be easily
    removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 ESB can
    be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact SOA needs.
</p>

<p>
    You can download this distribution from <a href="http://wso2.org/downloads/esb">
    http://wso2.org/downloads/esb</a> and give it a try.</p>

<h2>How to Run </h2>
<ol>

  <li>Point your browser to the URL https://localhost:9443/carbon</li>
  <li>Use "admin", "admin" as the username and password to login as an admin</li>
  <li>If you need to start the OSGi console with the server use the property
    -DosgiConsole when starting the server. The INSTALL.txt file found on the
    installation directory will give you a comprehensive set of options and
    properties that can be passed into the startup script</li>
  <li>Sample configurations can be started by the wso2esb-samples script passing
    the sample number with the -sn option (Please
    have a look at the samples guide for more information, on running samples)</li>
