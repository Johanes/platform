For LXC images don't download the qcow2 images, but download the tar.gz file from
For example to download ubuntu precise, visit
http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/precise/current/
and look for the image

precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz    30-Jun-2012 05:51  210M  Cloud image for 64-bit computers (Cloud Image/EC2 tarball)

ubuntu-12.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz

Create a folder called original_image inside a folder of your choice. eg:/opt/lxc (you will pass this folder as image-root in the following command)
Put the image into /opt/lxc/original_image folder.

Now you can customize this image(resize, install new packages etc) using the scripts provided in this folder.

For example to install lamp packages into the ubuntu precise image do the following

./customize_image.sh image-id=1236 image-user=yang image-password=yang ip1=10.100.1.20 ip2=192.168.254.2 image-root=/opt/lxc template=lamp image-size=3G original-image=ubuntu-12.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz

image_id -id of the image. 
image-user - default user account in the instances created from the image
image-password - default user password
ip1 - load balancer ip
ip2 - additional ip.
image-root - Put the downloaded image into <image_root>/original_image folder
template - template to customize the image
image-size - The original image will be resized to this size. (in Giga bytes)
original-image - original image archive name(.tar.gz)

This will resize the image to 3G and install lamp packages.

You can provide your own template instead of lamp in the above command. To do that you need to implement your own template in image_setup_base/hooks.d/configure_software file. To do that you can learn how it is done for lamp template in the the same file. Copying the lamp() template function into a new funciton say myfunc() and customizing it, is the best approach.
