<BODY>
    Package providing the structure and some implementation for the auto-start mechanism.
    This is used primarily under JDO usage where the user wants memory of the classes that were
    known about the previous time, or simply to make some classes known to the persistence mechanism.
    With JPA usage, or when using JDO with <i>persistence.xml</i> this is typically not needed.
