/**
 * Manager of connections for a StoreManager, allowing ManagedConnection pooling, enlistment in transaction.
 * The pool caches one connection per poolKey object. The poolKey is typically the ExecutionContext (ObjectManager).
 * The <i>allocateConnection</i> method can create connections and enlist them (like most normal persistence 
 * operations need) or create a connection and return it without enlisting it into a transaction, for example the 
 * connections used to generate object identity, create the database schema or obtaining the schema metadata.
 * The <i>closeAllConnections</i> method is typically called when the owning object (ExecutionContext) is being closed
 * giving us chance to close all retained connections for that poolKey.
 * <p>
 * Connections can be locked per object poolKey basis. Locking of connections is used to
 * handle the connection over to the user application. A locked connection denies any further
 * access to the datastore, until the user application unlock it.
